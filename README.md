## Solving 3x3 SLAE
### Overview
This [website](https://thedeiw.github.io/SLAE-Gaus-and-LU-methods-/) presents a tool for solving 3x3 systems of linear algebraic equations using the Gaussian elimination and LU decomposition methods. It features an interface for inputting matrix coefficients and provides feedback on matrix validity.

The solution involves breaking down the matrix into simpler forms for computation. Gaussian elimination sequentially eliminates variables, while LU decomposition divides the matrix into lower and upper triangular matrices.
### Reason for creation
Created as part of a lab assignment for the "Numerical Methods" course, the project helps students learn theoretical principles and test them using personalized input scenarios.

_Button "Input" fills all fields with numbers given by your own variant._
